Planned Move to Azure
=====================

We wanted to make you aware that on Saturday August 18 at 10:00am PDT (1:00pm EDT, 17:00 UTC),
Read the Docs will be having a **scheduled downtime of approximately 4 hours**.
During this time, we will be moving our service to our new home on Microsoft Azure.

To ensure the stability and performance of our system,
we are performing this upgrade during the weekend
which is our period of lowest usage.

During this maintenance window, documentation will still be serving
but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will not be available.
New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.

Thanks for your support and understanding!
