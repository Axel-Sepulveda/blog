Uniregistry sponsors Read the Docs and Open Source
==================================================

We're excited to announce our second partner in our `Ethical Advertising`_
campaign: Uniregistry_.

Today we’re excited to announce an important sponsorship partner that we’ve added in 2017 with Uniregistry_.
Our goal with our ethical advertising program was to provide important funding to major open source projects like Read the Docs.

Domain registration was identified early as a natural partner to our program, because it sits in the stack of necessary infrastructure for all of us that work in this worldwide business of the internet.
We felt the need to find the right partner, because historically we feel that domain registration companies left room for improvement in the customer experience.
This is a quick review of the criteria we used to reach the conclusion to partner with Uniregistry.

Usability
---------

Uniregistry continues to heavily invest in making every interaction point simple, minimal and sharp looking as possible.
This pays off in a good complete experience that should delight you.
It doesn’t suck.

Domain registration starts with search, and their clutter-free, fast-loading search gets the job done across a vast collection of TLDs worldwide.
1-clickness is a goal to not hide key domain management capabilities 10 clicks away to respect your busyness.

They also have native apps on iOS and Android that work well,
and make it easy to grab a new domain.

Security
--------

Two step verification is built right right in to the product.
They are the registrar for people who own one domain or who own thousands, so they had to build in security to put you in complete control.
Since they have handled the use case of the most demanding domain owners in the industry, you get the same security even if you just buy one.

Open Source
-----------

Uniregistry has built their business on open source.
The original introduction to the company was through Mark Jones, who joined the company in 2016.
Mark is their Technical Director and well known to the Python community.


Price
-----

Our analysis showed that most domain registrar's who provide good pricing are constantly up-selling and playing renewal games that cost money.

Uniregistry has built a business like we would, where they are hyper-focused on domain registration.
They don’t offer hosting, so you are not being up-sold constantly.
Their pricing across the board is competitive, while providing a first class experience.
`Try it`_ and see if you agree.

Additionally, we worked with Uniregistry to give you a 25% off discount for not only new domain purchases, but also your transfers.
Use `DOCS25` as your coupon code as our thank you to for supporting open source through your domain registration.

Transparency
------------

Uniregistry doesn't hide things like auth codes from you.
Click and you shall receive.
Domain renewals for competitors are a major source of cheap profit for them, and a major source of pain for your wallet.
Uniregistry has taken a different path, as a for-profit business that is valuing the transparency required to be a long term partner to you in managing your online presence.

Capabilities
------------

Even when you only have one domain, it’s critical to have ultimate control over it for transfers and protecting your asset.
Uniregistry thinks like we do about this challenge, and unlike their competitors, they have built an outstanding customer experience that gives you the power and capabilities you need to manage your domains.

Story behind the story
----------------------

Uniregistry’s was founded by Frank Schilling.
They are the fastest growing registrar on the planet, driven by Frank, who is is the best-known individual on the planet when it comes to domain registration.
Under his direction, they have grown to be the operator of 25 new TLDs, with more than 1.5 million domains under management.

Treat people like you want to be treated
----------------------------------------

Uniregistry offers free WHOIS Privacy.
No nickle-and-diming to protect your privacy.
In recent years, those of you who have your phone numbers and emails on domain registration have come to experience being heckled by automated phone calls and spam.
Uniregistry takes this off the table with no extra cost to you.

Fair Marketing
--------------

You know when marketing is bad.
Good marketing communicates to you in a conversation in a timely manner.
Uniregistry places the customer first.
Since Frank was and is their biggest customer, they seem to get it, and communicate enough to manage your assets but they don’t pester you for money.
