Running ads with Sentry
=======================

We're excited to announce our first partner in our `Ethical Advertising <http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html>`_ campaign:
`Sentry <https://sentry.io/>`_.
Sentry seemed like an obvious partner here,
because it shares a lot of the same values that we do.
They have been a supporter of open source for a long time,

First and foremost,
Sentry is also trying to build a sustainable business around open source.
They also do a lot of work to give back to the community,
supporting projects like the Django REST framework `campaign <https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/>`_ and the Django project `campaign <https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/>`_

Each of our respective repositories is on GitHub:

* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry
* https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org

We are excited to be working with companies that see the value in open source and treating our users with respect.
Making a commitment to do advertising in an ethical manner allows us to feel good about serving ads,
and allows users to know their privacy isn't being violated.

`Sentry <https://sentry.io/>`_ is a product that allows developers track their errors in realtime.
It allows you to proactively respond to issues on your site,
keeping both your users and your ops team happy.
We whole heartedly recommend their product,
and thank them for their sponsorship.
