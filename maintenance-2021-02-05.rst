Scheduled Maintenance - 2021-02-05
==================================

On Friday, February 5, from 5:00 pm PST (1:00 am UTC Saturday) to 7:00 pm PST,
Read the Docs for Business (readthedocs.com) will be partially unavailable due
to scheduled maintenance. We will be performing several database maintenance
operations, which will require us to bring some services offline.

During this maintenance window, dashboard access, new user authentication, and
project building will be unavailable, however **hosted documentation will still
be available for users that are already logged in**.
