Upcoming features

   about its sunsetting <https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/>`__
   and migrating to a newer version at your earliest convenience.
-  On the commercial side, we’ll work on allowing more fine tuned
   privacy controls on builds created from pull requests.
-  We intend to release version 1.0 of ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` with some
   changes and deprecations, and draft a plan for future releases.
