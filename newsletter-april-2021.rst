Read the Docs newsletter - April 2021
=====================================

This is the first of our monthly newsletters, in which we would like to
openly share with you the most relevant updates of Read the Docs,
offer a summary of what new features we shipped to our users
during the previous month,
and advance what things we will be focusing on for the following weeks.

Company highlights
------------------

-  We have a new colleague! `Juan Luis <https://blog.readthedocs.com/archive/author/juan-luis-cano-rodriguez/>`_
   will be working with us as Developer Advocate, with a focus on fulfilling
   the goals of `the CZI grant we were
   awarded <https://blog.readthedocs.com/czi-grant-announcement/>`_,
   improve our public facing documentation,
   and spread the word about our service.
-  xxx we saw an increment of X % page views
-  We have `a new status page <http://status.readthedocs.com/>`__ so you
   can have a glance at how our service is working.

New features
------------

-  There is a `new support form <https://readthedocs.org/support/>`__ in
   case you need to send us a request related to your project or
   account, like asking for more resources, change the project slug, and
   so forth.
-  You can now build your project using Python 3.9 by setting your build
   image to ``testing``. Please `open an
   issue <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/new>`__
   if you find any problems with it.
-  Now `all MkDocs projects use the latest version by
   default <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/7869>`_.
-  We expanded a few areas of our user documentation: we added `a brand
   new guide on reproducible
   builds <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html>`__,
   considerably improved our `guide on using
   conda <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/conda.html>`__,
   and `started recommending MyST for writing Markdown with
   Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html#using-markdown-with-sphinx>`__.

Current focus & known issues
----------------------------

-  xxx commercial site reliability
-  xxx security

Upcoming features
-----------------

-  Anthony will work on releasing version 1.0 of ``sphinx_rtd_theme``
   with some changes and deprecations, and outline a plan for future
   releases.
-  On the EthicalAds side, David will focus on more customized ad
   targeting and improvements for the reporting interface.
-  Our new hire, Juan Luis, will work with scientific projects to
   improve their documentation and migrate it to Read the Docs, and
   `start drafting a Sphinx tutorial for
   newcomers <https://github.com/orgs/readthedocs/projects/93>`_.
-  Eric will be split between `hiring a frontend
   developer <https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/>`_,
   `the CZI grant <https://blog.readthedocs.com/czi-grant-announcement/>`_,
   and Ads improvements.
-  Manuel, on the other hand, will focus on `Single Sign-On
   Authentication for our commercial
   site <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commercial/single-sign-on.html>`_,
   and improving the stability of our deploy process.
-  Installing custom system packages is a very common request, so
   Santos will be working on improving the build configuration, as
   well as our Embed API.
-  And finally, on the commercial side, weâ€™ll work on allowing more
   fine-tuned privacy controls on builds created from pull requests.
