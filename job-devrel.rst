Job Posting: Developer relations with documentation skills
==========================================================

.. |role| replace:: developer relations

.. include:: /hiring/intro.rst

About the job
-------------

This job will be our first |role| hire.
You will be responsible for developer marketing and improving our documentation.

At the beginning of this year, we received a :doc:`grant to support scientific software</czi-grant-announcement>`.
Given this grant, the job will have two major parts:

* For 2021, around half your time will be spent working on work related to our grant.
  This focuses on improving our guide and tutorials for Read the Docs and supporting software in the ecosystem (Sphinx, docutils)
* The other half of your time will be spent working on Read the Docs itself, outside of the grant funding.
  This includes managing a number of improvements to our documentation structure, and improving our `user guides <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/>`_.

Historically, we have had a very developer-focused audience,
but we are trying to make our documentation more appropriate for less technical users.
One of our first priorities will be creating more beginner and tutorial content for Read the Docs.
This could perhaps include some video or audio content,
along with written docs.

The other major part of this job will be creating and promoting the grant work we're doing.
We will need to do outreach into the Data Science community,
and work to understand the needs of these users.
Based on those needs,
we will work to build new resources and raise awareness of existing resources that are relevent to these users.

Technical Details
-----------------

Read the Docs is a large Python & Django web application.
The current technologies that we're using are:

* Sphinx/reStructuredText for documentation
* Read the Docs for documentation building & hosting :)
* Our blog is somewhat custom, built on Sphinx as well
* Twitter for most of our marketing and developer relations

You will be responsible for authoring documentation and marketing content using reStructuredText, using Sphinx and Pelican.

In terms of the develop relations work,
the following skills will be useful:

* Interviewing project owners to understand their documentation needs and how we can help them
* Publishing blog posts promoting the content we're writing
* Making small images and videos to make our content more compelling
* Other content marketing and developer marketing skills will be very useful
