Job Posting: Developer relations with documentation skills
==========================================================

.. |role| replace:: developer relations

About the job
-------------

This job will be our first |role| hire.
You will be responsible for developer marketing and improving our documentation.

We have recently gotten a :doc:`grant to support scientific software</czi-grant-announcement>` in 2021.
Given this grant, the job will have two major parts:

* For 2021, around half your time will be spent working on work related to our grant.
  This focuses on improving our guide and tutorials for Read the Docs and supporting software in the ecosystem (Sphinx, docutils)
* The other half of your time will be spent working on Read the Docs itself, outside of the grant funding.
  This includes managing a number of improvements to our documentation structure, and improving our `user guides <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/>`_.

Historically we have had a very developer-focused audience,
but we are trying to make our documentation more appropriate for less technical users.
One of our first priorities will be creating more beginner and tutorial content for Read the Docs.
This could perhaps include some video or audio content,
along with written docs.

The other major part of this job will be


Technical Details
-----------------

Read the Docs is a large Python & Django web application.
The current technologies that we're using are:

* Sphinx/reStructuredText for documentation
* Read the Docs for documentation building & hosting :)
* Our blog is somewhat custom, built on Sphinx as well
* Twitter for most of our marketing and developer relations

We historically have chosen overly technical tools, but we are hoping to make things more standardized over time.
We are planning to move our marketing pages away from our application and into a static site generator,
and doing similar things with our blog.
This should make it easier to write and deploy new marketing pages,
as well as make it easier to onboard people with less technical backgrounds.
