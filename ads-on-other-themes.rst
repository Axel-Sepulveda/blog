Ads on Other Themes on Read the Docs Community Sites
====================================================

We've been running our `ethical advertising <http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html>`_ campaign for over a year now,
and it is starting to show success on making Read the Docs more sustainable. 
Over this time,
we have only been running ads on Read the Docs themed projects.
The primary reason for this is making sure that our display of ads is consistent and doesn't negatively impact the user experience.
We're trying hard to build a sustainability model that respects our users,
and making sure things are well designed and unobtrusive is an important part of this.

Over this time we've planned on expanding to other themes,
but we haven't simply because it didn't give us any value.
We serve about 60% of our traffic on the Read the Docs theme,
so until we have 100% of those views sold,
we haven't needed to expand.
We've now hit that limit,
so we're planning to expand to our second most popular theme:
**Alabaster**

We're also launching a **Community Ads** initiative,
which will highlight projects in the community that we believe in and care about,
and use 10% of our traffic for those ads.

To explicitly repeat:
**we will start showing ads on Alabaster themes on Read the Docs** starting in the beginning of May.
We plan to roll this out in stages:

* We'll start with an initial ad that points to this blog post for a few days
* Then showing our Community Ad on Alabaster projects for a few days
* Finally, we'll expand to our full paid ad rotation

Read below to learn more about these specific projects,
and what we're doing with the money it brings in.

Changes to our advertising program
----------------------------------

Along with this expansion of where we show the theme,
we're also updating our ad program in a few ways.
In particular:

* We will start showing Community Ads on 10% of our traffic, for free. This will promote other open source projects, and other products/projects that we think are important, but don't have money for ads.
* Projects that opt out of normal advertising, as previously supported, will now be shown *only* ads from our Community Ads partners.
* Users will be able to opt out of all paid ads with a profile setting, but will still see Community Ads.

Community Ads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a large number of projects that we care about in the software ecosystem. A large number of them are operated like we have for the past 6 years, with almost no income. Our new Community Ads program will highlight one of these projects each month.

We'll show 10% of our ad inventory each month to support an open source project that we care about.
We are working to set up an application process to be considered,
but we've already picked our first Community Ad recipient: **Beeware**.
They are running their own sustainability campaign,
and we're hoping to help out!

`Beeware <http://pybee.org/>`_ is a collection of projects that can be used to help develop, debug and launch Python software. Each tool follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. The primary goal is to bring Python to the browser, mobile devices, and everywhere else that we wish Python ran natively. 

Project & User opt out changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously we've allowed project owners to opt out of advertising. We're now expanding this to allow users to opt out of advertising as well.
However,
we're using the opportunity of launching our Community Ads to be able show them to folks who out opt.
We know some folks disagree with the ideas of companies paying for their attention,
but we believe that seeing community projects promoted is something that should have value for people.

To repeat,
**Users and Projects can now opt out of paid ads, but will be shown Community Ads instead**.


What we're doing with the money
-------------------------------

We have a couple primary things that we are spending money on,
and plan to spend money on:

* Paying full-time salaries for the primary maintainers of Read the Docs (Eric Holscher & Anthony Johnson)
* Paying for contractors in order to support our users

I'd like to talk a bit more each of these.

Paying Salaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the Docs is a massive internet service.
We serve around 30 million _pageviews_ a month (calculated by Google Analytics, this is over 200 million _requests_ a month.)
We are currently running the entire show with two full-time staff,
which is incredibly understaffed compared to most internet services.

We hope that over time we will be able to pay salaries for more people,
but even if we have another $56,000 a year,
it's hard to find qualified people who will work at that rate.
So,
we're focusing on hiring contractors at this point.

Paying to support our users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the primary goal of our new income from advertising.
We have started paying `Manuel Kauffman <https://github.com/humitos>`_ for his time helping support our users on our GitHub issue tracker.
We hope to expand this program with new income,
so that we are able to provide our open source users with better support.

Please give us feedback
-----------------------

We're making these changes to hopefully continue to make a sustainable business model for our support of open source.
We try to be transparent with our thinking,
and along those lines we'd like to know your thoughts.
If there is anything else we could be doing better,
please `let us know <mailto:rev@readthedocs.org>`_.
