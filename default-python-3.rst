Defaulting to Python 3
======================

Starting February 1st, 2019, new projects getting started with Read the Docs
will use Python 3 by default. While it is stil possible to configure your
project to use Python 2.7 with :ref:`our config file <readthedocs:yaml__python>`,
we think it's important for the ecosystem to help push projects towards adopting
Python 3.

For the time being, Python 3.6 will be our default Python 3 version, however we
will have Python 3.7 available for testing very shortly as well.
