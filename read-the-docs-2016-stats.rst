Read the Docs 2016 Stats
========================

Congrats,
you made it through 2016!
Read the Docs has been rolling along,
and we've had another interesting year as well.

For a quick summary:
* Our level of contributions and commits has gone down a good bit this year.
* Our traffic and user growth has been quite steady, which is particularly impressive at the scale we're operating at.
* Our efforts at funding the project have also started to bear fruit, and 2017 is looking to be the year that Read the Docs will become a sustainable project.

We will go into more detail below about each of these details.

.. note:: 

	You can always see our stats for the last `30 days`_. 

	Our posts from 2013_, 2014_, and 2015_ are also available.

Community
---------

This year, we had:

* `18 people`_ who committed code (-50% from last year)
* `1032 commits`_ (-46%)
* `461 issues`_ - 236 open, 225 closed (-42%)

Our community activity is much lower this year,
which is a multi-year trend that we've been seeing.
I believe this is in part because of a maturing project and code base,
and also because we've struggled getting more contributors.
The code base and project are reasonably hard to set up,
and we haven't had enough time and focus on onboarding contributors into the project.

I'm not sure what the best path forward here is.
I've personally onboarded and tried to build many people into ongoing contributors,
and have gotten discouraged with the lackluster results over the years.
My hope is that we can eventually make it easier to contribute and start to get more folks helping.

The other path forward is to start using some of our funding to build a paid team who helps with the project.
This seems like the most likely option given the history state of contributions.
It would be great if projects could exist under ongoing volunteer maintenance,
but there is a `plethora of examples`_ in the open source ecosystem of this not being the case.

Page Views
----------

Our stats:

* 252 Million Page Views (+48%)
* 56 Million Unique Visitors (+47%)

.. From Google Analytics

Page view growth has been steady again this year.
This is particularly impressive given the scale that we're operating at.
I'm quite happy to see folks using Read the Docs more and more,
as well as seeing many other projects using our theme or other concepts that we've pioneered in the general software ecosystem.

We remain one of the `largest sites`_ on the internet.

Site Stats
----------

The stats, in total numbers:

* 53673 projects (+91%)
* 64585 users (+65%)

Read the Docs has some high profile projects that push a lot of traffic.
There are however thousands of smaller libraries and projects that fill out that full range of documentation that we host.

We are happy to host documentation for all open source projects,
and are glad the community finds the service useful.

Funding
-------

Our hosting costs continue to be sponsored by `Rackspace`_,
which is fantastically generous of them.

Our largest initiative this year has been our attempt at building `Ethical Advertising`_ into our site.
The project has been well received,
which we have been grateful for.
Funding is a fundamental part of sustainability,
and we're glad people are supportive of our efforts to get there.

The best outcome of our sustainability efforts is that we're going to be able to hire someone part time to handle support for our users.
This has always been somewhere that I've felt we have not done our best work,
and I'm excited we will be able to give it more sustained work.

Our other efforts at sustainability are also progressing. Our `commercial hosting service`_ is starting to slowly build revenue from users who want private documentation.
We hope to continue to build that into another source of revenue,
which can help support development of the code base.

Conclusion
----------

2016 has been another year of mixed results.

We are continuing to see more users and folks who are reading documentation on our platform.
We think the software industry is caring more and more about documentation by the year,
and we're helping to play a role.

The downside is that as a community project,
we still haven't getting much contribution.
I think we're pretty firmly set on the path of having paid contributors,
after years of trying to cultivate a volunteer community to help support the project.
I have mixed feelings about this,
but knowing that there is a sustainable future for the project is the most important thing in my book.
We're continuing to work towards that goal,
and I believe 2017 will be the year we get there.
