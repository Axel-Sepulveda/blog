Ethical Advertising Update
==========================

It has been three years since we first launched :doc:`ads on Read the Docs <ads-on-read-the-docs>`
and while we gave a limited update in our :doc:`2018 stats<read-the-docs-2018-stats>`,
we figured it was time to give an update on ethical advertising,
how it is working, and some upcoming changes.


Results
-------

**Our ethical advertising model is still going strong.**

Despite a slow start to the year, we expect to earn about $75,000 from advertising in Q2.
This brings our advertising revenue back to the level
before our ads were :doc:`added to major ad blocking lists <ads-and-adblocking>`.

While we do earn money from other sources such as our commercial offering,
advertising continues to be our largest source of revenue and has allowed us
to expand our team to five full-time people.
Compared with three years ago when we were scraping along with very little money,
our community issue tracker and support requests receive prompt responses.


Progress
--------

We've made great progress on advertising over the past year.

* We survived a major hit to revenue from ad blocking
  without resorting to cat and mouse games of changing ad layouts and APIs to avoid ad blockers.
* Our `community ads program`_ has been significantly expanded.
  We are actively running free advertising for over ten open source software conferences.
* While we never tracked users with advertising,
  we put in place stricter :doc:`Do Not Track <do-not-track>` privacy protections.
  We continue to believe that advertising can be well targeted without tracking users.
* We launched an advertising vertical specific to
  :doc:`promote open jobs <lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews>` to our developer audience.

Our ethical advertising approach, with no user tracking, has been key to our sustainability
and has allowed us to continue to build new features and give back to our community.


Our new ad format
-----------------

One type of ad we've wanted to try but it took a while to get it right was text-only ads.
From the start, we were very keen on text-only advertisements
because they aren't as obtrusive as image-based ads
and they are easier for advertisers to create and experiment with multiple variations.
What we didn't know was whether users would engage with them at similar rates to our other ads.

We ran a small experiment with a text-only house ad
on the Read the Docs documentation itself and the results were very promising.
Engagement rates were over double our site average
and even compared favorably with the same ad in the sidebar including an image.

I'd like to thank Eric Berry over at `CodeFund <https://codefund.io/>`_ for some great ideas
and insights around this kind of ad format.

Currently, we only show advertising on a :doc:`subset of Sphinx themes <ads-on-other-themes>`
and about 30% of our site traffic does not get an ad.
We purposely did this slowly to make sure our ads look integrated with Read the Docs and less obtrusive to users.
**This new ad format will allow us to show advertising on all documentation themes.**

We plan to roll this new ad format out more widely in stages:

* To start with, we are going to enable this ad format for community and house advertising
  on pages that already have an ad on them.
  As always, we never display two ads on the same page so this ad will be instead of any other ad.
* After that, we will allow paid advertisers to use this new format.
* We will email users of custom documentation themes to let them know this change is coming.
* At first, we will show only community and house ads on these custom themes.
* Finally, we'll turn on our normal ad rotation to all themes. We expect to complete this by July.

We will closely monitor feedback from document authors, readers, and advertisers during this process.
If you have questions or comments on this, please `let us know`_.

Users can opt-out of paid advertising themselves and for any projects they maintain
although they will still see community ads.
Gold members of Read the Docs enjoy an ad-free experience
and for companies we have our `commercial offering at readthedocs.com`_
which is always ad-free.

Thanks
------

Advertisers always have a choice where to direct their marketing spend
and for many of them it would have been simpler to just go with the usual behemoth advertising platforms
rather than advertising with a niche site like Read the Docs.
I want to thank all our advertisers who believed in our ethical advertising approach.
